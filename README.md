# Romeo Science Olympiad Flashcards
A static website to help Romeo Science Olympiad students study for their events using flashcards. In the future, the scope may expand to serve as a centralized resource site for all teams in the district. The goal is to maintain an accessible cache of event resources year-to-year, reducing coaching burden and building a more robust and resilient program.
